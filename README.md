# Presentation
I've designed this CMS because I wanted to simplify and optimize the way we're creating content. Wordpress is way too complex for what it does. Welcome to ABE (A Better Engine) : This CMS will make you create content in a snap and publish it on the web in no time !

# Contributing
We've bet on Abe 1 year ago, investing more than 100 000,00EUR in this project. We have decided to open source it so that our customers and you can freely use Abe to create wonderful experiences in a snap !

We will maintain Abe for the next 3 years and have a dedicated 20% Full Time Equivalent developer on it. We need you to improve Abe, feel free to join us and submit PR's !

# Roadmap
We have a 1 year roadmap (estimation) with the following versions. You'll notice that as we're developing in agile mode, we've chosen to create and present groups of features but no date of delivery (feature-driven release planning : http://www.scrum-institute.org/Release_Planning.php). This roadmap doesn't take into account the bugs which could be opened during this timeframe. Depending on the severity of these bugs, we'll be able to fix shortly after their discovery and include those fixes in specific Hotfix versions or include these bugs in the roadmap.

The 2.x releases will focus on quality and stability and will be covered by Unit tests + functional tests.
The separation between the engine, the API server and the front will be reinforced by putting each part in its own repository
The documentation will be rewritten and included in the modules
As a major new feature, it will be possible to create a template from partials.

## Roadmap of the next 2.x releases
- the stateful manager of Abe has to become responsible of pagination of articles (huge performance boost)
- A homepage will arrive (at last !) on the frontend
- It will be possible to create filtered views on the manager frontend
- Refactoring the editor has to be done
- The load testing scenarii will be open sourced (based on Locust)
- Precompiling of templates has to be fully tested
- since Abe has become stateful, clustering has been removed. Implement a solution to permit clusters of Abe
- Add template creation from partials
- Structure will be editable from abe, as references
- templates and partials will be uploadable
- Video training will be produced

## Roadmap of the 3.x releases
- Separate the engine, the REST server and the client
- rewrite the client in react
- create an Electron version
- More to come !
