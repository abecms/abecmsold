# Abe Plugins

Abe plugin system is based on npm modules : You can install a plugin which has been deployed on npm or resides on github with a proper package.json.
Furthermore, you can create your own scripts without having to register it in npm (see below).

# Install a plugin

run 

```shell
abe install some-plugin-name
```

this will install the plugin in the node_modules directory and add a new entry inside abe.json file (it will create abe.json if it doesn't exist).

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "some-plugin-name"
  ]
}
```

You can install a specific version of the plugin this way:

```shell
abe install some-plugin-name@1.0.0
```

this will install the plugin in the node_modules directory. The entry in abe.json:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "some-plugin-name@1.0.0"
  ]
}
```

You can also install a module hosted on github. This is particularly useful for modules you don't want to make public and don't have a private npm repo.
The syntax is abe install user_or_org/repo#branch 
user_or_org being your user or organization github id, repo being the repo and branch being the branch or the tag

run 

```shell
abe install user_or_org/myrepo
```

this will install the plugin in the node_modules directory and add a new entry inside abe.json file (it will create abe.json if it doesn't exist).

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "user_or_org/myrepo"
  ]
}
```

You can install a specific version of the plugin this way:

```shell
abe install user_or_org/myrepo#1.0.0
```

The entry in abe.json:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "user_or_org/myrepo#1.0.0"
  ]
}
```

# Install all plugins

run 

```shell
abe install
```

this will fetch all plugins listed in abe.json and npm install the plugins

# Use custom scripts

Custom scripts are created under "scripts" directory. Follow the same structure as for a plugin. 
Example for a module "abe-hint" under scripts:

Example from abe-hint plugins

```
website/
  |_ scripts/
    |_ abe-hint/
      |_ hooks/
      |  - hooks.js
      |_ partials/
      | - some_partials.html ...
      | - some ...
      | - ...
      |_ routes/
        - my_route.js ...
```

This way, you'll be able to create custom scripts which you don't want to share between your different Abe projects. You can name your module as you want.

# Dev plugins

> How to create plugins

Inside website (under scripts folder) create a directory with the name of your choice (this name will be the name of your plugin)

You can then add hooks or template override

Example from abe-hint plugins

```
website/
  |_ node_modules/
    |_ abe-hint/
      |_ hooks/
      |  - hooks.js
      |_ partials/
      | - some_partials.html ...
      | - some ...
      | - ...
      |_ routes/
        - my_route.js ...
```

Once you'll be satisfied with the way your module works, you'll then be able to create a regular npm module and install it on your project with the command abe install my_module

## frontend javascript

Your partial can import css/js file

You can register some event to alter abe

for example :

```
website/
  |_ node_modules/
    |_ my-plugin/
      |_ partials/
        - styles.html
        - my-scripts.js
```

content of styles.html

```html
<script src="/my-scripts.js"></script>
```

content of my-scripts.js

```javascript
abe.json.saving(function (e) {
  abe.json.data.someVariable = 'test'
})
```

```someVariable``` will be saved into content json file, because the json was changed before saving

## Add route

```
website/
  |_ node_modules/
    |_ my-plugin/
      |_ routes/
        - my_route.js ...
```
You now get a new route at ```http://localhost:8000/plugin/my-plugin/my_route``` (this is created fron plugin name 'my-plugin' and 'my_route.js'

Example file:

```javascript
'use strict';

var route = function route(req, res, abe) {
	res.set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
	res.send(JSON.stringify({
		route: 'search',
		success: 1
	}))
}

exports.default = route;
```
